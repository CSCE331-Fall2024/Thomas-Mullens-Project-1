        <h2>How to Play Magic: The Gathering</h2>
        <p>
            Magic: The Gathering (MTG) is a collectible and strategic trading card game developed by Wizards of the Coast. It is played between two or more players, each representing a powerful planeswalker—a wizard capable of traveling between different planes of existence and casting spells. Players build decks made up of various card types, including creatures, spells, enchantments, and lands, with the ultimate goal of reducing their opponent's life total from 20 to 0. Here's a detailed breakdown of the game:
        </p>
        <h3>The Basics</h3>
        <p>
            In Magic, players begin with a deck consisting of 60 cards, with some formats requiring a larger or smaller number of cards. The standard deck-building rule allows no more than four copies of any card, except for basic lands. Each player starts the game with 20 life points and draws an initial hand of seven cards. Players then take turns, following a series of steps and phases.
        </p>
        <h3>Turn Structure</h3>
        <p>
            A turn is divided into multiple phases, with each phase having specific rules:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Untap Step:</strong> Players untap all tapped cards, such as creatures or lands, at the beginning of their turn.</li>
            <li><strong>Upkeep Step:</strong> Some cards have effects that trigger during the upkeep, so players resolve those effects before drawing a card.</li>
            <li><strong>Draw Step:</strong> Players draw one card from their deck at the start of each turn.</li>
            <li><strong>Main Phase 1:</strong> Players can cast spells, summon creatures, play land cards, and activate abilities during this phase.</li>
            <li><strong>Combat Phase:</strong> Players declare which creatures are attacking and, if applicable, which creatures will block. Combat damage is then dealt.</li>
            <li><strong>Main Phase 2:</strong> Players can perform similar actions as in Main Phase 1 but after combat has been resolved.</li>
            <li><strong>End Step:</strong> Players end their turn, discarding down to seven cards if they hold more than that, and resolve any end-of-turn effects.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Card Types</h3>
        <p>
            There are several key card types in Magic, each with unique functions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lands:</strong> These cards generate mana, which is used to cast spells. Basic lands come in five types: Plains, Islands, Swamps, Mountains, and Forests, corresponding to the game’s five colors: white, blue, black, red, and green.</li>
            <li><strong>Creatures:</strong> These cards represent monsters, warriors, and beings that can attack opponents or defend the player.</li>
            <li><strong>Instants:</strong> These spells can be cast at almost any time and have immediate effects.</li>
            <li><strong>Sorceries:</strong> Like instants, but they can only be cast during the player's main phase.</li>
            <li><strong>Enchantments:</strong> These cards provide ongoing effects that can influence the game over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Artifacts:</strong> Non-creature cards that offer special abilities or resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Planeswalkers:</strong> These powerful cards represent allies that can use their own abilities to affect the battlefield.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Winning the Game</h3>
        <p>
            The most common way to win is by reducing your opponent's life total to 0. However, there are alternate win conditions, such as forcing your opponent to draw from an empty deck or using specific cards that state you win the game under certain conditions.

    <!-- Section 2: What is EDH? -->
    <section id="edh">
        <h2>What is EDH?</h2>
        <p>
            EDH, or Elder Dragon Highlander, also known as Commander, is one of the most popular multiplayer formats in Magic: The Gathering. The format was originally created by players as a fun, casual variant of Magic, but it has since been officially adopted by Wizards of the Coast. EDH is beloved for its large deck size, unique deck-building rules, and social, political gameplay. Here’s a breakdown of how EDH works:
        </p>
        <h3>The Commander</h3>
        <p>
            In EDH, each player selects a legendary creature to serve as their Commander. This creature dictates the color identity of your deck, meaning you can only include cards that match the color(s) of your Commander. Your Commander begins the game in a special zone called the "command zone" and can be cast from there at any time, with its casting cost increasing by two mana each time it's returned to the command zone.
        </p>
        <h3>Deck Construction</h3>
        <p>
            EDH decks contain exactly 100 cards, including the Commander. Unlike other formats, EDH follows a singleton rule: you can only have one copy of each non-basic land card in your deck. This creates a high level of variability in each game and requires players to build more diverse and creative strategies.
        </p>
        <h3>Starting Life and Gameplay</h3>
        <p>
            In EDH, players start with 40 life points instead of the standard 20. The higher life total allows for longer games and bigger, splashier plays. EDH is typically played in multiplayer pods of four players, although it can be played with any number of players.
        </p>
        <h3>Win Conditions</h3>
        <p>
            There are multiple ways to win in EDH. The most common is by reducing your opponents’ life totals to 0. However, EDH has two other unique win conditions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Commander Damage:</strong> If a player takes 21 points of combat damage from any one Commander over the course of the game, they lose, regardless of their remaining life total.</li>
            <li><strong>Alternate Win Conditions:</strong> Some cards have specific conditions that, when met, cause a player to win the game outright. These cards are often included in EDH decks to create interesting win conditions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Social and Political Gameplay</h3>
        <p>
            One of the key aspects of EDH is its social nature. Unlike 1v1 Magic, EDH games often involve alliances, politics, and negotiations. Players may form temporary alliances to take down a strong opponent or discuss strategies to advance their own interests. However, these alliances are always tenuous, as there can only be one winner in the end.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, EDH encourages a more relaxed and fun atmosphere compared to competitive Magic formats. It’s a great way to explore powerful cards, creative strategies, and unique interactions that might not be viable in other formats.

    <!-- Section 3: What is cEDH? -->
    <section id="cedh">
        <h2>What is cEDH?</h2>
        <p>
            cEDH, or Competitive Elder Dragon Highlander, is a variant of the Commander format where the focus shifts from casual and social gameplay to competitive, high-stakes Magic. In cEDH, players aim to optimize their decks for maximum efficiency, using the most powerful cards and strategies available in Magic to win as quickly as possible. This creates a faster-paced, more cutthroat environment compared to traditional EDH.
        </p>
        <h3>cEDH Deck Construction</h3>
        <p>
            Like regular EDH, cEDH decks are 100 cards and follow the singleton rule, with a legendary creature as the Commander. However, the deck-building philosophy in cEDH is vastly different. In cEDH, players use the strongest cards available, including fast mana sources, infinite combo pieces, and disruptive cards designed to lock down opponents or protect their own strategies.
        </p>
        <h3>Key Strategies in cEDH</h3>
        <p>
            The primary strategies in cEDH revolve around winning the game as quickly and efficiently as possible. The following are some of the most common strategies seen in cEDH:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Infinite Combos:</strong> Many cEDH decks rely on infinite combos, where a set of cards creates an endless loop that generates infinite resources, such as mana or damage, allowing the player to win instantly.</li>
            <li><strong>Stax:</strong> Stax is a strategy that aims to lock down the game by preventing opponents from performing basic game actions, such as casting spells, playing lands, or drawing cards. Stax players use cards that tax resources, force sacrifices, or prevent certain actions to control the pace of the game.</li>
            <li><strong>Control:</strong> Control decks focus on countering opponents' spells, removing key threats, and protecting their own win conditions. Control players bide their time until they can deploy a game-winning combo or overpower their opponents with card advantage.</li>
            <li><strong>Combo-Control Hybrids:</strong> Many cEDH decks blend combo and control elements, using counterspells and disruption to protect an infinite combo or other fast-paced win condition.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Fast-Paced Nature of cEDH</h3>
        <p>
            Unlike regular EDH, where games may last for an hour or more, cEDH games are often decided within the first few turns. Most cEDH decks aim to win by turn 3-5, utilizing explosive starts with fast mana sources like <em>Mana Crypt</em>, <em>Sol Ring</em>, and <em>Chrome Mox</em>. Because of this, interaction is key, and players must be prepared to disrupt their opponents' combos while advancing their own win conditions.
        </p>
        <h3>Common Cards in cEDH</h3>
        <p>
            In cEDH, the card pool is highly optimized, with many decks sharing key cards due to their sheer power level. Some of the most common cards seen in cEDH include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mana Rocks:</strong> Cards like <em>Mana Crypt</em>, <em>Sol Ring</em>, and <em>Mox Diamond</em> are staples due to their ability to generate mana quickly, allowing for explosive starts.</li>
            <li><strong>Counterspells:</strong> <em>Force of Will</em>, <em>Mana Drain</em>, and <em>Force of Negation</em> are critical in cEDH for protecting combos and stopping opponents from winning.</li>
            <li><strong>Combo Pieces:</strong> Many cEDH decks rely on two or more cards that form a winning combination, such as <em>Thassa’s Oracle</em> and <em>Demonic Consultation</em> or <em>Food Chain</em> with <em>Prossh</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>Tutors:</strong> cEDH decks often run a suite of tutors like <em>Vampiric Tutor</em>, <em>Imperial Seal</em>, and <em>Demonic Tutor</em> to quickly find combo pieces or answers.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>cEDH Community and Culture</h3>
        <p>
            cEDH has developed a distinct community within the larger EDH player base. While regular EDH is known for its casual, fun-loving spirit, cEDH players thrive on competition and optimization. cEDH games are often played in tournaments or competitive environments, though some players still enjoy it as a fast-paced alternative to casual Commander games.
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s important to note that while cEDH is a competitive format, it still shares some of the social aspects of EDH. Politics can play a role in multiplayer games, but alliances are often short-lived, and players must always be aware of when an opponent could attempt to win the game.
