                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        Howdy how are you, I am Thomas Mullens, a junior at Texas A&M University majoring in computer science with a minor in business. 
                        I expect to graduate in the spring of 2026. 
                        This is my first major project involving web design in class 331 however, I will work with a team to complete even more advanced web design projects soon, which I look forward to. 
                        I am eager to further expand my coding knowledge by continuing classes and participating in an internship later next summer.
                        I enjoy working with friends, one of which is Nathan Mcculluog and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nathanmccullough18/" target="_blank">here is his Instagram</a> if you would like to contact him.
                        I also enjoy listening to music, my favorite band is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/67ps5pbKVO7V9Fcb4lTIXz?si=ERHoXMweTs-yIj8FjvaVjw">Windrose.</a>  
                        When I am not coding I like to play Magic the Gathering at game club and with friends. If you have not heard of the game you can go to my AI generated page for a quick run down on how to play. I also enjoy playing video games mainly on my Playstation. 
                        My Twitch is <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dragondmthsa" target="_blank">DragonDmthsa.</a>
